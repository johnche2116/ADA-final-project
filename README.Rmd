##Overview

This project investigates the association between meeting physical activity (PA) guidelines and blood pressure (BP) control among U.S. adults using the NHANES 2019–2020 survey cycle.

Using the NHANES complex sampling design, we estimate survey-weighted prevalence ratios (PRs) to evaluate:

  1. Whether meeting PA guidelines is associated with controlled BP (<130/80 mmHg).

  2. Whether the association remains significant after adjusting for confounders.

  3. Whether the association varies by sex, BMI, or other demographic factors (interaction model).

All results and exported outputs are included in the outputs/ folder

##Data Source

Data come from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a nationally representative survey conducted by the CDC.

NHANES datasets used:

DEMO — Demographics

BPX — Blood pressure readings

PAQ — Physical activity

BMX — Body measures (BMI)

SMQ — Smoking

ALQ — Alcohol use

DIQ — Diabetes questionnaire

Cycle used: 2019–2020


##Study Population
Inclusion Criteria
  Adults age ≥18 years

  Complete BP and PA data
 
Exclusion Criteria

  Pregnant participants

  Missing covariates

  Implausible values (BP, PA, BMI)

#Variables
Outcome: BP Control

Defined using mean SBP/DBP: <130 / 80 mmHg = controlled

Exposure: Meeting PA Guidelines

   Yes/No based on PAQ:

   ≥150 minutes/week moderate, OR

   ≥75 minutes/week vigorous activity

Covariates

  Age (continuous)

  Sex

  Race/ethnicity

  BMI (continuous)

  Smoking status

  Diabetes status


##Statistical Methods

All analyses conducted in R using survey-weighted methods.

Descriptive statistics: weighted means and proportions

Regression: Poisson models with robust SEs to estimate prevalence ratios

Models:

Main adjusted model

Interaction model (PA × sex, PA × BMI)

Diagnostics performed:

Multicollinearity (VIF)

Influence/fit checks

Confirmation of correct survey specification

##Findings
Main Model (Adjusted PRs)

In the fully adjusted model:

Meeting PA guidelines was not significantly associated with BP control

PR = 0.953

95% CI 0.904–1.005

CI includes 1 → not significant

Although the estimate suggests a slight protective effect (PR < 1), this was not statistically significant.

Significant predictors of lower BP control:

Older age (PR = 0.988; CI 0.986–0.990)

Higher BMI (PR = 0.987; CI 0.982–0.992)

Non-Hispanic Black race (PR = 0.801; CI 0.750–0.854)

Other race category (PR = 0.912; CI 0.848–0.981)

Alcohol use (PR = 0.881; CI 0.811–0.958)

Significant predictors of higher BP control:

Current smoking (PR = 1.083; CI 1.025–1.145)
(Note: Counterintuitive finding; could be due to medication adherence or residual confounding.)

Non-significant predictors:

Diabetes status

PA in the main model


##Interaction Model

Two interaction terms were evaluated: PA × Sex and PA × BMI.

PA × Sex

PR = 0.979

95% CI 0.910–1.053

Not significant
The effect of PA on BP control does not differ by sex.

PA × BMI

PR = 0.991

95% CI 0.985–0.998

Significant
The effect of PA varies slightly by BMI, though the effect size is very small.

PA main effect (in interaction model)

PR = 1.247

95% CI 1.036–1.501

Significant

After accounting for interactions (mainly BMI), meeting PA guidelines is associated with better BP control.


##Interpretation Summary

In the main adjusted model, PA was not significantly associated with BP control.

In the interaction model, PA became significant, indicating that its effect depends partly on BMI.

BMI, age, race, and alcohol use were important determinants of BP control.

Results highlight the complexity of BP control and suggest that the benefit of PA may not be uniform across population subgroups.
